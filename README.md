# Thanos (minecraft-node-thanos)

Thanos is NodeJS port of [eponymous PHP library](https://github.com/aternosorg/thanos), but unlike mentioned library - it removes unused chunks in-place, without need to copy any files. It also can reduce file size of a Minecraft world by more than 50%.

This library also do use inhabited time instead of blocklists, chunks generated by software that doesn't support that (like [flying-squid](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/flying-squid) server) will be ignored.

Currently, only the Minecraft Anvil world format (Java Edition) is supported.
